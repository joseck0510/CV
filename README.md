## Jos√© Antonio Copovi-King

I'm a results orientated, learning junkie. I have built a career over the last 15 years as a project manager, helping companies grow by building effective teams. Most recently I have completed a full stack software development course at Makers Academy. Looking to begin my career in software development by working for an innovative and socially responsible organisation, working in a collaborative environment.
