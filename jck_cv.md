## José Antonio Copovi-King

 I am a full stack software developer, with experience working within TDD focussed agile environments.  Software development is all about solving problems and there is always an opportunity to be learning and growing, which ticks all the boxes for me! So I  decided to take the plunge and embark on a new career starting with the full stack software development course at [Makers Academy](http://www.makersacademy.com/) in London, which I am proud to have graduated from in September 2016.

 I also have 15+ years experience building and managing software project teams within a PRINCE 2 framework.

 I'm now looking to begin my career in software development by working for an innovative and socially responsible organisation, working in a collaborative environment which is passionate about the quality of its code.

## :eyeglasses: Skills

#### Software Development Skills/Projects

During the last 3 months with Makers Academy I have learnt the fundamentals of good coding practice: Agile, TDD, pair programming and XP values.  Specifically I have worked on projects which have involved the following technologies:

- Ruby on Rails
- Javascript
- PostgreSQL with DataMapper and Active Record ORMs
- RSpec
- Capybara
- Jasmine
- HTML
- CSS

#### Results Oriented and Able to Work Under Pressure

I have worked as as a project manager for the last 15 years, helping to deliver additional value to various business products over that time. These projects required a methodical & collaborative  approach working with cross-functional teams to achieve common business goals on time and on budget and ensuring constant communication with senior managers and board representatives in blue chip multinational client companies.

- Managing a complex software development contract with an overseas provider (Sedex Exchange Ltd)

- Successful creation and delivery of a plan to migrate a complex business critical compliance management software system to a newly built system and contract.   This gave me the opportunity to work closely with an Agile development team on a greenfield platform project.  Part of this work involved the explanation of the Agile process to a non-technical Board. (Sedex Exchange Ltd working with Open Credo Ltd.)

- Responsibility for the creation of new revenue models from inception, pitching the Board, delivery and rapid profit turn around (Supply Chain Compliance Support Services at Sedex Exchange Ltd) which turned a £250k  profit within the first year of operation.

#### Practical Experience of Woking With an Agile Development team

- Working closely with the Open Credo team, gave me real world experience of Agile development processes (Kanban) and a well executed TDD approach.

#### Able to work well with diverse groups of people

I have worked in international multi-disciplinary teams for the last 20 years within the project management, finance and software development areas.  During this time I have also helped to build highly effective project teams.

- Worked with a Hong Kong development agency and Secure Works UK to plan and implement a data security review and security penetration test

- Acted as technical project advisor on the Sedex Board for 4 years, reporting on development, technical contract and security issues.


## :paperclip: Recommendations



*"I have worked with Jose as a supplier on a number of critical projects for Sedex which covered the implementation of complex mission critical software. The delivery projects also covered the adoption of a more agile approach to software delivery something which was new to Sedex. I was impressed by how hard he worked to achieve sensible outcomes in potentially complex situations and the way in which he handled the process of interfacing between the internal PRINCE2 process and the more agile approach used by the delivery team to the satisfaction of all."* <cite> --  Jonas Partner
CEO OpenCredo and founder Specto Labs </cite>


*"I worked closely with José, having been brought in as a PPM consultant, to deliver a systems solution for one of Sedex's key clients; this solution required data feeds from the strategic Sedex platform. José was a pleasure to work with; he was an ideal client, keen to learn, happy to take advice and supportive of the need to be firm with Sedex's client about the scope, timeline and pricing of delivery as well as of the need to make some tough delivery team decisions. His ability to think strategically - and to persuade other key stakeholders to support him - is evident in his promotion to a role where he has been responsible for developing new platforms for Sedex which reduce reliance on external parties, increase flexibility/timeliness of system changes and offer more cost-effective solutions. José acts with integrity and fairness to all: suppliers, clients and colleagues alike. He is well liked and respected and is a good leader."* <cite> -- Julia Berry
