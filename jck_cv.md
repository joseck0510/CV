## José Antonio Copovi-King

 I am a full stack software developer, with experience working in TDD focussed agile environments within a commercial setting - startup and established businesses.

 I have always enjoyed working in technology, and being constantly challenged. So when the opportunity arose to take time out in 2016 and complete a full stack development boot camp with [Makers Academy](http://www.makersacademy.com/) I grabbed it! I'm now looking forward to rolling my sleeves up and getting stuck into a career as a software developer, working within an XP focussed team.

## :eyeglasses: Skills

#### Software Development Skills/Projects

During the 4 months with Makers Academy I have learnt the fundamentals of good coding practice: Agile, TDD, pair programming and XP values.  Specifically I have worked on projects which have involved the following technologies:

- Ruby on Rails
- Javascript
- PostgreSQL with DataMapper and Active Record ORMs
- RSpec
- Capybara
- Jasmine
- HTML
- CSS

#### Strong Commercial Experience

I have worked as as a project manager for the last 15 years, helping to deliver additional value to various business products over that time. These projects required a methodical & collaborative  approach working with cross-functional teams to achieve common business goals on time and on budget, ensuring constant communication with senior managers and board representatives in blue chip multinational client companies.

- [Managing a complex software development contract with an overseas provider.](#icti)

- Successful creation and delivery of a plan to migrate a complex business critical compliance management software system to a newly built system and contract.

- Responsibility for the creation of new revenue models from inception, pitching the Board, delivery and rapid profit turn around (Supply Chain Compliance Support Services at Sedex Exchange Ltd) which turned a £250k  profit within the first year of operation.

#### Practical Experience of Working With an Agile Development team

- Working closely with the Open Credo team, gave me real world experience of Agile development processes (Kanban) and a well executed TDD approach.

#### Able to work well with diverse groups of people

I have worked in international multi-disciplinary teams for the last 20 years within the project management, finance and software development areas.  During this time I have also helped to build highly effective project teams.

- Worked with a Hong Kong development agency and Secure Works UK to plan and implement a data security review and security penetration test

- Acted as technical project advisor on the Sedex Board for 4 years, reporting on development, technical contract and security issues.


## :paperclip: Recommendations

*"I have worked with Jose as a supplier on a number of critical projects for Sedex which covered the implementation of complex mission critical software. The delivery projects also covered the adoption of a more agile approach to software delivery something which was new to Sedex. I was impressed by how hard he worked to achieve sensible outcomes in potentially complex situations and the way in which he handled the process of interfacing between the internal PRINCE2 process and the more agile approach used by the delivery team to the satisfaction of all."* <cite> --  Jonas Partner
CEO OpenCredo and founder Specto Labs </cite>


*"I worked closely with José, having been brought in as a PPM consultant, to deliver a systems solution for one of Sedex's key clients; this solution required data feeds from the strategic Sedex platform. José was a pleasure to work with; he was an ideal client, keen to learn, happy to take advice and supportive of the need to be firm with Sedex's client about the scope, timeline and pricing of delivery as well as of the need to make some tough delivery team decisions. His ability to think strategically - and to persuade other key stakeholders to support him - is evident in his promotion to a role where he has been responsible for developing new platforms for Sedex which reduce reliance on external parties, increase flexibility/timeliness of system changes and offer more cost-effective solutions. José acts with integrity and fairness to all: suppliers, clients and colleagues alike. He is well liked and respected and is a good leader."* <cite> -- Julia Berry
